# Medi-Track | An easy solution to the problem of accessing  medical records.


Here we have a **Database management systems** project that solves the issue of accessing medical records for patients and doctors.

The purpose of this project is enable easy access and manipulation to medical records for patients, doctors and administration alike.

This project will enable users to **add, edit and delete**  records from our database. There will be certain constraints on who will have access to certain records,

Patients will only have access to their own desgnated records and will not have access to other patient details. Doctors will have access to all of their degnated patient details but will not have access to other Doctor details. 
The Administrator will have access to all details, to act as a control.


As a TechStack, We will be using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript for our front end** and will be using **js as our backend**.
We will be using Supabase as our database, as it provides us with a clean easy to navigate UI and it is easy to integrate into React.js.

The Contributors to this project:

**Kylie Deviller, Cameron Burgoyne , Yarushiyan Rajah and Saif Miskin**
